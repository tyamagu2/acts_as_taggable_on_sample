This application aims to show you an example of tagging functionality implementation with [ActsAsTaggableOn gem](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on) and [Tag-it jQuery plugin](https://github.com/aehlke/tag-it).

# Known Issues
- The app always tries to enable tag-it and thus raises error by accessing gon properties that do not exist in some views.
